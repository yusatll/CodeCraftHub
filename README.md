# User Management Service

This project is a User Management Service built with Node.js and MongoDB. The service includes features such as user registration, login, and profile management. The project structure follows best practices for code organization, error handling, and security.

## Project Setup

### 1. Set up a New Node.js Project
1. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to create the project.
2. Run the following command to create a new directory for your project:
```bash
mkdir user-management-service
```

3. Navigate into the project directory
```bash
cd user-management-service
```

### 2. Initialize the Node.js Project
Run the following command to initialize a new Node.js project:

```bash
npm init
```



### 3. Install Required Dependencies
Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies for your project:
```bash
npm install express mongoose bcrypt jsonwebtoken
```

- Express: A web framework for Node.js.
- Mongoose: An object modeling tool for MongoDB.
- Bcrypt: A library for password hashing.
- JsonWebToken: A library for handling JSON Web Tokens for authentication.

#### Project Structure

After setting up the project, create the following directories and files within your project:
```bash
user-management-service/
│
├── src/
│   ├── config/
│   │   └── database.js       # MongoDB connection configuration
│   ├── controllers/
│   │   └── userController.js  # User-related controller logic
│   ├── models/
│   │   └── userModel.js       # User schema and model
│   ├── routes/
│   │   └── userRoutes.js      # API routes for user operations
│   └── index.js              # Entry point of the application
└── package.json
```

### 4. Implement the User Management Service
**Controllers** (`src/controllers/userController.js`)

Define functions for:

- User registration
- User login
- Profile management


**Models** (`src/models/userModel.js`)

Define the user schema using Mongoose to structure the user data in MongoDB.

**Routes** (`src/routes/userRoutes.js`)

Define API routes for:

- User registration
- User login
- Profile management

### 5. Configure MongoDB Connection

In the `src/config/database.js`, configure the MongoDB connection using Mongoose.

### 6. Set up the Express Server

In the `src/index.js` file, set up the Express server and configure the API routes for user operations.

### 7. Test the User Management Service
To test the service, run the following command:
```bash
node src/index.js
```
You can test the API using tools like Postman or from a frontend application.
